# Project Gem
> Welcome to Project Gem...

Project Gem interactivity relies on the user identifying clear and intuitive visuals that convey the critical points of learning reading and writing in a way that is exciting and easy to understand. 

Project Gem makes use of auditory cues and signals like audio playback to help the users gain understanding of phonics by listening and repeating what they hear.

## Project Gem - Powerful Results

### Improved Communication Skills

- Teaching content and reinforcing what has been learned through interactive gameplay will allow users to better learn a broad collection of educational basics with gamified elements that unfold progressively to better teach the English language as well as math and simple geometry.

### Lifetime of Academic Advantages

- Whether it is introduced to the user as an early start or as an aid to help students who need extra help, Project Gem offers resources that are easy to access to aid in improvement at various levels of understanding.

### Enhanced Cognitive Process

- Engaging and exciting, the gameplay mechanics allow a progression from what has been learned in the game to better help users make sense of what they learn every day.


### Better Opportunities

- We hope that through helping children learn, we can open pathways in their futures that may not have been otherwise available to them. We believe mastery in early stages sets a strong foundation for future success in all realms of learning.


### Flow

- The evolution of the challenges users face in game ensures a manageable yet challenging experience to put users in the best positions to internalize educational content and to want to become engaged.
